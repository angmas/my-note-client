# My Note

My Note is a note collection applicaton. Once a user signs up and
they are presented with a button to add a new note and a list of their existing
notes (if they have any). The user is able to edit and delete their notes by
clicking on the buttons to the left of the note title.

User actions are accesible in the upper right hand corner of the page. The user
 simply clicks on the drop down menu and chooses the option they want: changing
 passwords or signing out.

This version currently available is in beta testing. Form field validation code
is in progress.

## Retrospective
I severely underestimated the amount of time that I needed to build out this
application. My plan was to do the planning and design work (i.e. wireframes) on
the application on day 1, get the backend built on day 2, get the front end
done on day 3, and use day 4 for bugs and READMEs.

Planning took longer because I spent too much time on designing complicated
features. Backend took longer because of typos and missing parameters that
took a long time to chase down. Front end took WAY TOO long because of modals
and checkboxes. And something like circular references. All (except planning),
shared the same issue of me not knowing enough syntax. I knew what behavior I
wanted, but it took time for me to research, practice, and then implement.

To meet this deadline, I did not code any form field validations and didn't
style the UI as much as I would like to. Despite this, I feel like I learned a
heck of a lot and I'm proud of what I have.
